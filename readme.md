<h1>Indexation Checker</h1>
<p>A tool I made for my daily work. Made with Bootstrap, JavaScript and PHP</p>

<p><strong>Still in development</strong></p>

<p><strong>The problem:</strong></p>
<p>In my daily work I have tasks on multiple projects. Because of the constant switching back and forth I make some mistakes - more than 1 H1 tag, lack of "noindex, nofollow", links containing "dev" or "staging" and so on. <br> So I decided to help myself.</p>

<p><strong>The solution:</strong></p>
<p>The idea behind this tool is simple. You put your website data (currently name and link) in a form. This data is saved in JSON file with previously added websites. Than on demand you can check every website for potential mistakes.</p>

<p><strong>Things I plan to implement:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Check for robots tag</li>
<li>Check for multiple H1 tags</li>
<li>Check for links containing "dev" and "staging"</li>
<li>Option to remove websites</li>
</ul>
